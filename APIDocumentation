Provide proper Swagger/Postman API documentation

To provide proper Swagger/Postman API documentation, you can follow these steps:
Define your API using Swagger or OpenAPI specification.
Use Swagger UI or Postman to test your API.
Import your API definition into Postman.
Generate documentation from your API definition in Postman.
Customize your documentation by adding descriptions, examples, and other details.
Publish your documentation to make it available to consumers.

Here are some additional details for each step:

Define your API using Swagger or OpenAPI specification: Swagger and OpenAPI are both specifications for defining REST APIs. Swagger is a set of tools for working with OpenAPI, including a UI for testing APIs and a code generator for generating server and client code. You can define your API using the OpenAPI specification, which is a YAML or JSON file that describes your API's endpoints, parameters, request and response bodies, and other details.

Use Swagger UI or Postman to test your API: Swagger UI is a web-based tool for testing APIs defined using the OpenAPI specification. You can use Swagger UI to send requests to your API and view the responses. Postman is a similar tool that allows you to test APIs using a desktop application. You can use Postman to send requests to your API and view the responses, as well as save requests for later use.

Import your API definition into Postman: Postman allows you to import API definitions in a variety of formats, including Swagger and OpenAPI. To import your API definition into Postman, select "Import" from the sidebar and choose the file containing your API definition. Postman will create a new collection based on your API definition, which you can use to test your API.

Generate documentation from your API definition in Postman: Postman can generate documentation for your API based on your API definition. To generate documentation, select "APIs" from the sidebar and choose your API. Then, select "View schema documentation" to view the documentation generated by Postman.

Customize your documentation by adding descriptions, examples, and other details: Postman allows you to customize your documentation by adding descriptions, examples, and other details. To add a description to an endpoint, select the endpoint and enter a description in the "Description" field. To add an example request or response, select the endpoint and choose "Examples" from the dropdown menu. You can also add other details, such as authentication information and headers, to your documentation.

Publish your documentation to make it available to consumers: Postman allows you to publish your documentation to make it available to consumers. To publish your documentation, select "APIs" from the sidebar and choose your API. Then, select "Publish" and choose a publishing option, such as a public link or a private workspace. Once your documentation is published, consumers can view it by following the link or accessing the workspace.
